# Neural Networks typology

## Learning goals
By the end of this lectures students should be able to:
* [ ] Compare the architecture of common types of Neural Networks
* [ ] Compare the type of pre-processing required by common types of Neural Networks
* [ ] Compare how different types of layers work on the data they receive
* [ ] Identify the hyper-parameters that are most useful to optimise when working with different common types of layers
* [ ] Predict the likely impact of different hyper-parameters in the performance of Neural Networks
* [ ] Identify the functions required to use common layers in Keras
